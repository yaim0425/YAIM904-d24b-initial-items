# YAIM0425 d24b – Initial Items 🎒

## 📦 Description

**YAIM0425 d24b – Initial Items** allows server owners and players to define a list of items that **every player receives automatically when they join the game**.

This MOD is designed to simplify early gameplay, testing scenarios, multiplayer starts, or custom progression setups by ensuring all players begin with predefined resources.

---

## ⚙️ How it works (Player view)

* When a player **joins or logs into the game**, they automatically receive the configured items
* The same item list applies to **all players**
* Items are granted directly to the player’s inventory
* Works for:
  * Single-player games
  * Multiplayer servers
  * New and existing players

---

## ⌨️ Controls & Permissions

* 🧩 **Default hotkey:** `Ctrl + I`
  * Opens the interface to define the initial item list
* 🔒 **Only administrators** are allowed to:
  * Modify the list of initial items
  * Apply changes that affect all players

Non-admin players can receive items, but **cannot change the configuration**.

---

## 🧩 Use cases

* 🚀 Faster early-game start
* 🧪 Testing and sandbox environments
* 👥 Multiplayer balance (equal starting items)
* 🛠️ Custom scenarios and modpacks

---

## ⚠️ Warnings

* 🚨 This MOD can **significantly alter game balance**
* 📦 Large item lists may overflow player inventories
* 🔁 Items are given **on player login**, not only on world creation
* ❌ Not recommended for strict vanilla progression games
